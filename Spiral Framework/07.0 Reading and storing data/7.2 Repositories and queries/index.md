## 06.2 Repositories and queries

Repositories in Spiral Framework provide a way to encapsulate database queries related to a specific entity. You can use the `select` method of the `Repository` class to create queries. This method returns a `Select` object, which you can use to add conditions to your query and fetch the results.

```php
$users = $orm->getRepository(User::class)->select()->where('username', 'test')->fetchAll();
```

In the following example, we use the `select` method to create a query that fetches all `User` entities where the `username` is 'test'.

Repositories can be injected using a dependency injection container directly into your services or controller methods:

```php
final class UserController
{
    public function __construct(
        private readonly UserRepository $userRepository
    ) {
    }

    public function show(string $uuid): string
    {
        $user = $this->userRepository->findByPK($uuid);
        
        // ...
    }
}
```
