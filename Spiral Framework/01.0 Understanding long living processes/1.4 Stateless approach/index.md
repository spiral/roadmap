## Stateless Approach in Spiral Framework

Spiral Framework adheres to a stateless approach, optimizing the separation of concerns between business logic and infrastructure tasks. In this model, the PHP codebase is focused on the efficient delivery of business logic, while the infrastructure tasks are handled by the Golang-based application server. The PHP application remains stateless across requests, making it more scalable and easier to maintain. This approach allows Spiral Framework to leverage the strengths of both PHP and Go.
