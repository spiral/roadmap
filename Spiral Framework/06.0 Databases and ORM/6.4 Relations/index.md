## 05.4 Relations

Relations in Spiral Framework are managed through Cycle ORM. It allows you to define the relationships between your entities, such as one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many.

```php
namespace App\Entity;

use Cycle\Annotated\Annotation\Entity;
use Cycle\Annotated\Annotation\Relation\BelongsTo;

#[Entity]
class Post
{
    // ...

    #[BelongsTo(target: User::class, nullable: false)]
    public User $user;
}
```
